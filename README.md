# laravel-HTMLMin

Laravel HTMLMin is currently maintained by [Raza Mehdi](https://github.com/srmklive), and is a simple HTML minifier for [Laravel 5](http://laravel.com). It utilises Mr Clay's [Minify](https://github.com/mrclay/minify) package to minify entire responses, but can also minify blade at compile time. Feel free to check out the [change log](CHANGELOG.md), [releases](https://github.com/HTMLMin/Laravel-HTMLMin/releases), [license](LICENSE), and [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
